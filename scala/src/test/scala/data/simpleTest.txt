Japan says it is stepping up efforts to cool overheating fuel at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.

Helicopters dumped tonnes of seawater to try to prevent fuel rods melting, and water cannon joined in the operation on the ground.

Workers have also been laying new power cables to the plant to restart water pumps used to cool the reactors.
