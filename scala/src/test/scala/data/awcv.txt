DOB: 11th October 1984

I graduated with a 1st  class masters degree in electronic engineering from the University of Southampton in 2008 and 
spent the summer studying Mandarin and Chinese business in Beijing. I then joined TTP and have spent a year working 
in design consultancy  with a range of clients,  learning about their business  and  developing new technology for the 
utilities, medical and security industries. I am an embedded systems engineer who strives to make a difference, whether 
designing secure systems to eliminate phone theft or driving forward a large team to inspire the next generation of 
engineers by running a robotics competition.

September 2008 ­  The Technology Partnership – http://www.ttp.com
Present
Worked   with   a   breadth   of   clients   as   a   consultant   engineer   involved   with   both   research   and 
development projects.
•
Led a project to develop low power (µA) sensor units and a wireless data collection system, 
managing project finances and technical progress.
•
Designed the security infrastructure for a new mobile phone anti­theft product, and worked 
with industrial designers to craft usable security.
•
Implemented a timing critical radio protocol on ARM and AVR platforms.
•
Designed and implemented the database and IPC for an emergency messaging system, and 
led a user­centred design for the user interface.
Autumn 2006 ­  Student Robotics ­ http://www.studentrobotics.org
April 2008
Instrumental   in   the   founding   and   development   of   a   new   student   society   with   the   mission   of 
involving young people in engineering through the exciting medium of robotics. As overall project 
manager: led fund raising of £12,000 from University and a major industrial sponsor; managed 
major stakeholder relationships and organised 12 teams from local sixth forms and colleges to create 
autonomous robots to take part in a competition at the University in April 2008. Developed the high 
level software for vision processing, graphical robot simulation and a web based IDE.
Summer 2007

Roke Manor Research – http://www.roke.co.uk 
Analysed   the   performance   characteristics   of   a   mesh   network   in   a   real   world   environment, 
developing benchmarking tools and tracing the full network stack to identify throughput and latency 
issues. Found and patched a bug in a Linux kernel driver to enhance mesh reliability.

1999 – Present SciTech – http://www.scitech.co.uk
(Easter & Summer  Worked as both a teaching assistant and a course leader for a holiday school. For two weeks a year, 
School Holidays) in both English and Dutch International schools, I lead groups of young children in discovering 
science, technology and engineering in a fun environment. Developed and ran fun­filled courses on 
Time, Electricity and Energy.
In 2006 and 2008 I had the staff liaison role, recruiting and managing over twenty junior (school and 
university age) staff for the summer course.
Full time:
2003­2004
Summer:
2005 and 2006

AstraZeneca – http://www.astrazeneca.co.uk
Worked as a control systems engineer in a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility and led small, non 
systems   projects   in  disciplines   ranging   from   electrical   to   civil.   Developed   a   strategy   for   future 
development and work with complex process instrumentation, focusing on the control software and 
how to use these in a manufacturing environment. Helped manage an engineering shutdown and 
investigated validation status of the plants wide range of control systems.

Technical Skills
Programming – Experienced working in C, C++, Python, Java and Javascript. Programmed real time systems on PIC, 
AVR, ARM and MSP430 embedded platforms in C. Built a range of web and desktop systems in C++, Java, Python and 
Javascript – choosing the right tool for the job. 
Computing – Range of experience built on over a decade of using Linux, from Open Embedded installs through to high 
availability systems built on the Apache server platform. Have set up small to medium database systems with MySQL for 
speed and high availability.
Electronics  – Experience designing and debugging small embedded systems. I have a particular interest in robotics, 
embedded computing and computer architecture. Was involved in a student team developing a robotics control kit with 
vision system.

Transferable Skills
Team Working & Leadership – Strong team working and leadership skills developed running multidisciplinary projects 
at AstraZeneca and building a team of 25 students to run a robotics competition. 
Communication  –   A   decade   of   experience   communicating   scientific   and   technical   concepts   to   many   hundreds   of 
children, both as a teaching assistant and as a course leader. In industry, a broad range of presentation and informal 
communication techniques developed working with both local and international colleagues.
Organisation – Broad experience managing projects, ranging from web site development for small enterprises to high 
value CAPEX projects for a multinational. Time management, both my own and that of others in my team has proved 
vital in all aspects of professional life.
Problem Solving  – Recognise that problem solving is the heart of any engineering endeavour. Experience of brain 
storming and project development both alone and in multidisciplinary teams, with a particular strength in applying a 
strong computing background.
Working in a Regulated Environment – Developed operating procedures and technical means to implement software 
into a highly regulated industry with particular interest in control and management of business critical data in a secure 
fashion.

Personal Interests
Computing  – I have a passionate interest in all aspects of computing, from development of ground breaking software 
(particularly open source) to innovative new hardware.
Physics and general science  – I enjoy following developments in science, particularly those relevant to my chosen 
profession and I also have a strong understanding of classical physics.
Sport – I enjoy squash and skiing at an amateur level.
