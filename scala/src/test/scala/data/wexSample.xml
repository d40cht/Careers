            For some time, Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky back country.
            He had purchased Sinking Spring Farm in December 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.

            own son, saying "Both were good boys, but I must say — both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I
            ever saw or ever expect to see." Lincoln was affectionate toward his step-mother, whom he would call
            "Mother" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.

            owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of
            Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his
            supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.

        <paragraph>Throughout the election, Lincoln did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and
            county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain
            high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in
            the South except for a few border cities such as

            Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These
            focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood
            poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, "Honest
            Abe" and "the Rail-Splitter," were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the
            superior power of "free labor," whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own
            efforts.

            recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as

            to take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally

        <paragraph>In July 1862, Congress moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was
            to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal
            institution of slavery (the
            <space/>

                <target>Thirteenth Amendment</target>

            <space/>did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by
            rebels. This new law was implemented with Lincoln's "Emancipation Proclamation."
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States. In 1861 – 1862, however, he made it
            clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Freeing the slaves
            became, in late 1862, a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its
            leadership class. Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his sluggishness over slavery

                    or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I
                    could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and
                    leaving others alone I would also do that.

            , freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were
            liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: "I
            never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper." The
            proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his
            energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation.

            points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating
            the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his
            commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in
            Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using

            Lincoln's second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln

            , Lincoln said, with respect to slavery, “Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on
            some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be
            permanently maintained.” The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of
            the day require that Lincoln be examined “seriously as a man of ideas.” Lincoln was a strong supporter of
            the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to
            express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs.

            development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that
            Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal
            education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by “an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for
            reading and learning.” It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential
            in shaping his personal beliefs.

        <paragraph>Lincoln did, even as a boy, reject much of what organized religion had to offer, but the Calvinistic
            "doctrine of necessity" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the
            effect of this doctrine as “that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over
            which the mind itself has no control.”

            struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can
