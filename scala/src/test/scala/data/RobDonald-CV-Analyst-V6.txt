Profile – Systems and Data Analyst
I have experience in the analysis and design of solutions for new projects as well as
maintenance projects. In my last role, on a neurosurgical research project, I used R
and MATLAB for statistical modelling research and the statistical analysis of clinical
trial data. I was also heavily involved in the design of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical
studies including the required statistical techniques and sample sizes.
The software systems for the project used C#, Java and C++. I was involved in the
design and support of a C# web application used by research nurses for manual data
entry. I was required to design and implement a Java based application that produced
reports for each patient on the study. For the C++ section of the project I was required
to integrate new functions into an existing MFC based C++ application.
I am particularly skilled at quickly analysing the “big picture” and, because of my
understanding of the principles of software design using several languages, I am able
to rapidly adapt to the tasks of data preparation often required at the start of a
statistical investigation.
I have deliberately kept my technical skills up to date and I can work on standalone
projects with minimal supervision or within a larger team environment and I am
experienced in setting up development environments to support the full software
lifecycle.
I have extensive experience in the creation and presentation of material describing
complex problems. I am skilled at presenting this type of material to a non-specialist
audience often in an international setting.
I am currently studying part time (nights and weekends) for a PhD in Statistics and
Machine Learning at the University of Glasgow, School of Mathematics and
Statistics. I am jointly supervised by Professor Stephen Senn, a leading authority on
clinical trial design, and Professor Mark Girolami, Director of the Centre for
Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London.

following technologies:

Recent Project History
Jan 2008 – Dec 2010
Project Title: AvertIT (European medical research project, http://www.avert-it.org)
Roles: Statistical Analyst, R and MATLAB; Java, C++, C# Developer
Technologies: NetBeans 6.9 with SubVersion, Windows 2008 Server admin, MS
Visual Studio Tools, ASP.NET web application
Worked on EU funded medical research project as the statistical analyst and systems
programmer.
My project team worked with neurosurgical ICU clinicians in six teaching hospitals
around Europe and data security specialists from the National eScience Centre at the
University of Glasgow.
Techniques used: neural network research using Matlab, R, C and C++; Java
programming using the NetBeans environment with SubVersion source code control;
Windows 2008 Server admin; C# Data processing using MS Visual Studio; ASP.NET
Web based data collection application.
I presented progress reports to the neurosurgeons and their clinical teams in the six
countries involved in the study and also presented the team’s work to external
research groups.
I contributed to full technical progress reports required for yearly formal EU
evaluation and have attended the actual review meetings in Brussels and Glasgow. I
also analysed the trial data and presented interim results at meetings held in each of
the participating hospitals around Europe and at an international scientific conference
(ICP 2010, Tübingen, Germany).
The project produced encouraging research results, which were then taken to clinical
trial stage. A Phase 1 clinical study with 30 patients has been completed and the
project has now progressed to a Phase 2 clinical study, aiming to recruit another 46
patients.

Project Title: Data Collection Product, (C3 Global, SME providing enterprise
performance solutions, http://www.c3global.com)
Roles: Product Architect, Java Developer, JSP Developer
Technologies: Eclipse with SubVersion, Apache Tomcat Web Server
Worked on a Linux based self contained data acquisition system for international
supermarket refrigeration supplier (Danfoss, http://www.danfoss.com).
Starting from a limited client market requirement, I produced the concept design and
helped with the project proposal. I developed the secure communications layer used to
acquire data from the embedded systems on site. I supported the system integration
tests and handover to client. After a successful delivery, I carried out second line
support investigations as required.

Worked on an enterprise level data acquisition and service centre application for a
major supermarket refrigeration supplier (Danfoss, http://www.danfoss.com).
Designed the initial architecture of the system from client’s limited specification and
led the small team that produced the pilot system for the client. I was the technical
lead in the larger team that took the project to production level across two data centres
(USA/Europe) serving the global reach of the system. The system consists of a
heterogeneous server environment running Linux and Microsoft Server systems.
